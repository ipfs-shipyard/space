## Notes

* 2 use cases: (1) Satellite to Ground, and (2) Satellite to Satellite
* 3 core pieces: bus, payloads (crosslink control, antennae), mission processing (Linux)
* Runtime is powered on for a small duration (on demand)
* 3 tech parts: IPFS (trimmed down), content management (e.g. web server), network layer (most work needs to be done here)
* Constraints: high packet loss rates, variable bandwidth
* Sample protocol: CCSDS (Common Space Protocol) similar to IPV4
* Could take the API directly to the bus if applicable
* 128kbps bandwidth (decent amount is overhead)

## Follow Up

We plan to have regular meetings (TBD).  Non-mission data will be published in this repository.
