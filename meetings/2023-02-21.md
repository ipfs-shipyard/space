# Meeting on 2/21/2023 with Little Bear Labs, Lockheed, and Protocol Labs

## Notes

* Attendees: Ryan, Jon, Pete, Dietrich, David
* We decided that a dedicated CLI tool for forming control API messages is sufficient for manual operators.
* Ideal test payloads will be satellite imagery files in GeoTIFF format. Testing with several of these images across a variety of sizes will be necessary before any on-mission usage.
